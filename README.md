This is a modified version of Two Cherries Instruments's fret spacing
calculator to improve the UI and code design for future expansion.

## Noted Changes

* Unload/Stop works
* Spinner control for the number of frets
	* Integer value instead of float
	* Range checking for number of frets
* Constants created for core values
* Consolidation of drawing functionality into functions
* Almost-fully constrained sketch.  Sketch is fully constrained within itself.
